			I know what an erection feels like, Michael. Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr.: No, not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down. I'm gonna go get sexy. What a fun, sexy time for you.

Dad would stage elaborate situations using a one-armed man to teach us lessons. I've been in the film business for a while but I just cant seem to get one in the can. If I look like a man who made love to his wife last night – it's because I almost did. She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen.
